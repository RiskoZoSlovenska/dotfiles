# .riskorc

Risko's custom RC file — contains various aliases, PATH additions and functions that I find useful and want to keep synchronized between computers. Designed to work in both Bash and Zsh (untested).

Some functions expect non-default packages (such as `code` or `xclip`) to be installed.


## Installation

Clone the repo and copy/link the `.riskorc` file to `~/.riskorc`, and then add `. ~/.riskorc` to the main shell RC file.


## Docs

Run `riskohelp` for help.
